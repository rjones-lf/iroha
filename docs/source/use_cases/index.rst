Use case scenarios
==================

By reviewing application areas together, we can understand what Iroha is capable of providing.
Use cases here depict the mainstream scenarios of blockchain frameworks.
It can also be a starting point for your imagination to come up with new and more interesting ways where Iroha can be used.

(In this section we want to see something like https://github.com/takemiyamakoto/hyperledgerwp/tree/master/RelevantUseCases referring to Iroha. The idea is to describe as much as we can so that people can be inspired to use Iroha and can also use their imagination to come up with interesting application. This can be expanded later with good suggestions on hackatons and real-life examples in such use cases.)
